    /*

        Why copy constructor is needed?
        Because there is problem in copying the objects in this way,
            as this object has a member with dynamic memory

        Let's have a look at output:

            chaiOne:
            Chai Name: Lemon Tea
            Servings: 2
            _______________________________________________________
            copiedChaiOne:
            Chai Name: Lemon Tea
            Servings: 2
            _______________________________________________________
            _______________________________________________________
            chaiOne after modification:
            Chai Name: Modified Lemon Tea
            Servings: 2
            _______________________________________________________
            copiedChaiOne after modification:
            Chai Name: Modified Lemon Tea
            Servings: 2
            _______________________________________________________
            Destructor called!
            Segmentation fault (core dumped)

            
        1. Here, shallow copy of the object is created

        2. Hence, since teaName is in the dynamically allocated memory,
            during shallow copy, the reference to that memory location is copied.
            A new copy of teaName is not created in dynamic memory.
            It just copies the pointer teaName from chaiOne into copiedChaiOne.
            It means both objects share the same dynamic memory (i.e., point to same string in heap memory)

        3. Due to this, modification in teaName of one object,
            leads to modification in that of other object as well.

        4. Since we have to manually free the memory,
            we delete the pointer teaName,
            but, when the Destructor for first object is called the pointer teaName is deleted,
            and due to this when the Destructor for second object is called the pointer teaName does not exist.
            i.e., we are trying to delete same memory twice
            This leads to Segmentation Fault.

        5. Solution: Write a Deep Copy Constructor

    */

    /* Can't we use static memory with the pointers here?

        No, because when your class has a pointer data member, that pointer must point to valid memory
            for the entire life of the object. So it is not safe to use static memory.
    
            
        1. Hence, we cannot write, teaName = &name
            Because, When the constructor finishes, the local variable name goes out of scope.
            Now teaName points to memory that no longer exists (or is invalid) â€” a dangling pointer.
            
        2. Hence, we cannot simply just write, *teaName = name; instead of using 'new'
            Because, dereferencing only works after allocating memory (i.e., after initalizing the pointer)
